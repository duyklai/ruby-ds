# Ruby Data Structure Implementation

My implementation of a binary search tree, with traversal/search function breadth-first-search and depth-first-search included. Print tree function is modified code from [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-binary-tree-2-dimensions/). The rb file includes some very basic test code. This current iteration does not deal with repeating/same multiple of the same number in the array original array.

To run binary-search-tree.rb
```
$ cd binary-search-tree
$ ruby binary-search-tree.rb
```
